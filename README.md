# CODSOFT
This is a python repository which basically focusses on the projects i made during a month internship at Codsoft

So, The challenge was to cover any three of the tasks/projects assigned by the company and this has really been a great internship where i learnt about the GUI libraries in python and basic python programs to execute.
The projects are:
1. A random password generator which uses a user prompt of desired number of characters and then generates a password with random characters
2. A GUI based simple calculator which takes 2 inputs from the user , user specifies the operation and then it executes the operation over the inputs provided.
3. A GUI based to do list which is easy to use, adds task on user prompts and removes task on user prompts.
